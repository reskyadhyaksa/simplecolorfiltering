# simplecolorfiltering
This code is a simple way to color filtering using numpy, cv2, and mask from rgb color range
And for the filtering color is blue, you can change to what you want for example :

white : 
[230, 230, 255]
[255, 255, 255]

and if you want to detect color you can use ***"pyautogui.displayMousePosition"*** for detecting that things,
